"""doc
The `Result` objects allows performing operations over results lazily so that many file system calls can be avoided.
This is extremely useful when doing large parameter sweeps and plotting over slices of parameters.
The object stores some metadata about the result that can be inferred from the experiment description without needing to open the result file.

```python
results = loadResults(exp, 'returns.npy') # -> gives an iterator over Result objects

for result in results:
    print(result.path) # -> 'results/MountainCar-v0/SARSA/alpha-1.0_lambda-1.0/returns.npy'
    print(result)

# only load results from disk where alpha > 0.2
results = filter(lambda res: res.params['alpha'] > 0.2, results)
for result in results:
    plot(result.load())
```

    Load the result from disk.
    The contents of the results file are cached, so as long as this result file is accessible (e.g. not garbage collected) you will only hit the filesystem once.
    This is important for distributed filesystems (like on computecanada) where filesystem calls are extremely expensive.

    Note that if the result does not exist (e.g. compute canada job timed out), then an error message will be printed but no exception will be thrown.
    This way plotting code can still continue to run with partial results.
